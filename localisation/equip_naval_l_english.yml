 heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Heavy Cruiser III"
 heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Heavy Cruiser IV"
 heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Washington Naval Treaty was set up to prevent an arms race in cruisers, among other ships, but this seems inevitable. By keeping armor light, the weapons load can be increased."
 heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Despite new efforts at treaties, refitting lighter cruisers with heavier weaponry remains efficient, although armor is still limited."
 heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "As restrictions are increasingly ignored worldwide, more balanced heavy cruiser designs with more priority on armor can be built. Better anti-air guns allow these ships to cooperate in naval air warfare."
 heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Upscaled, longer and heavier designs with rapid-fire armaments are features in these final stages of heavy cruiser development."

 SH_battleship_2:0 "Super-Heavy Battleship II"
 SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The current state of the world no longer has any room for abiding by naval treaties. Without these limitations, we can focus entirely on creating the heaviest, most well-armed battleships of all time, able to engage multiple lesser vessels."
 SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "An improvement on our earlier super heavy design with stronger weapons and improved fire control systems."
 ARG_battleship_1:0 "Rivadavia Class"
 ARG_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Rivadavia-class was a pair of U.S.-built dreadnought battleships built for the Argentine navy in the early 1910s. They displaced 27,500 tons and were armed with twelve 305mm/50 call cannon as their main guns. They remained in service until the 1950s."
 ARG_destroyer_1:0 "Catamarca Class"
 ARG_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Catamarca-class destroyers were ordered by the Argentine Navy and built by the U.K. shortly before World War I. They were armed with four 120mm/50 cal main guns and four 533mm torpedo tubes."
 ARG_destroyer_2:0 "Buenos Aires Class"
 ARG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "Buenos Aires-class destroyers were built in the U.K. for Argentina between 1936 and 1938. They were based off the British G-class destroyers. They displaced over 1300 tons and were armed with four QF 4.7 in. Mark IX cannon as their main guns."
 ARG_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Garibaldi Class"
 ARG_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Garibaldi class represents a class of armored cruisers built for Argentina around the turn of the century. All were obsolete by the mid-1930s, with the last one being decommissioned by 1932. They were replaced in 1931 by the British-built Veinticinco de Mayo-class heavy cruisers."
 ARG_light_cruiser_1:0 "Libertad Class"
 ARG_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Libertad-class ships were given the designation of 'River Battleship' but were actually more comparable to the smaller, more lightly armed protected cruisers of the early 1900s. Two ships of the class were built in the late 1890s and were still in commission at the start of World War II."
 ARG_light_cruiser_2:0 "La Argentina Class"
 ARG_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Argentina light cruiser was built for Argentina by the U.K. in the late 1930s. She made several training cruises before the war but was placed in the active squadron to maintain Argentine neutrality. The ship was an enlarged version of the British Arethusa class, displacing 6500 tons and armed with nine 6 in. cannon as its main guns."
 ARG_submarine_1:0 "Santa Fe Class"
 ARG_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Santa Fe-class class represents three submarines ordered from Italy and delivered to Argentina in 1933. The three ships of the class formed the backbone of the Argentinian Submarine Force until 1960. They were nicknamed the 'Tarantinos' for the dockyards in Taranto, Italy where they were built."
 AST_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 AST_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 AST_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 AST_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy with quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 AST_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 AST_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 AST_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 AST_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 AST_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 AST_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 AST_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 AST_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 AST_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 AST_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 AST_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 AST_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 AST_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 AST_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 AST_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 AST_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 AST_destroyer_1:0 "Vendetta Class"
 AST_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes, which were transferred to the RAN to form the 'Scrap Iron Flotilla'. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 AST_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 AST_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes was the same as in the F class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 AST_destroyer_3:0 "Nizam Class"
 AST_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Nizam class was the designation of the J, K, and N class destroyers transferred from the RN. They were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 AST_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 AST_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 AST_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 AST_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 AST_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 AST_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 AST_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 AST_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
 AST_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 AST_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 AST_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 AST_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 AST_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 AST_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets."
 AST_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 AST_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 AST_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 AST_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 AST_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 AST_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 AST_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 AST_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 AST_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 AST_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 AST_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 AST_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 BRA_battleship_1:0 "Minas Gerais Class"
 BRA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Minas Gerais was a class of two dreadnought battleships built by the U.K. for Brazil in the early 1900s. They were active during World War II but far too obsolete for any serious duty, instead being used as coastal defense ships along the Brazilian coast."
 BRA_destroyer_1:0 "Marnhão Class"
 BRA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Marnhão was a British-built K-class destroyer that was sold to Brazil in 1922. The ship displaced just over 930 tons and was armed with four 4 in. guns."
 BRA_destroyer_2:0 "Juruena Class"
 BRA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Juruena-class destroyers were a series of six H-class destroyers ordered by Brazil from the U.K. in the late 1930s. The ships were never delivered, however, as the British requisitioned them once war broke out in 1939. They displaced over 1,300 tons, had good speed, and were armed with three QF 4.7 in. Mk IX cannon as their main guns, as well as eight 533mm torpedo tubes."
 BRA_destroyer_3:0 "Marcílio Dias Class"
 BRA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Marcílio Dias-class destroyers (sometimes referred to as M class, or Greenhalgh class) were three ships of the Brazilian Navy that were commissioned in 1943. They were based on the U.S. Mahan-class destroyers and were the first sizable ships built in Brazil. They displaced 1,500 tons and were armed with five 5 in./38 cal main guns."
 BRA_destroyer_4:0 "Acre Class"
 BRA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Acre-class (sometimes referred to as the Amazonas class) represents six destroyers built for the Brazilian Navy. None were completed before the end of the war. The ships were built in Brazil using a modified British design and some U.S. equipment to replace the six Juruena-class destroyers requisitioned by Britain at the start of the war."
 BRA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Bahia Class"
 BRA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Bahia class was a class of two British-built scout cruisers built for Brazil and delivered in 1910. The ships were heavily refit and modernized in the 1920s but were still a relatively obsolete design by the start of World War II. During the war, the cruisers primarily performed convoy escort duties."
 BRA_submarine_1:0 "Humaytá Class"
 BRA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Brazilian submarine Humaytá was ordered from Italy and delivered in the late 1920s. It was designed as a modified Balilla-class, which was designed as a deep-sea diver. It displaced nearly 1,400 tons and was armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes. "
 BRA_submarine_2:0 "Tupy Class"
 BRA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Tupy class was a class of Brazilian submarines built by Italy in the mid-1930s. They were smaller submarines, displacing just over 600 tons, and was armed with six 533mm torpedoes."

 CAN_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Algonquin class was the Canadian designation for British Battle-class destroyers. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 CAN_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 CAN_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 CAN_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
 CAN_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 CAN_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 CAN_light_cruiser_3:0 "Quebec Class"
 CAN_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Quebec class was the Canadian designation for British Crown Colony-class light cruisers. These were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range were somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses - Fiji and Ceylon."
 CAN_light_cruiser_4:0 "Ontario Class"
 CAN_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Ontario class was the Canadian designation for British Minotaur-class (or Swiftsure-class) light cruisers. These cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets."
 CAN_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 CAN_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 CAN_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 CAN_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 CAN_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 CAN_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 CAN_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 CAN_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 CAN_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 CAN_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 CAN_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 CAN_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."

 GER_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class"
 GER_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15") guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 GER_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class"
 GER_battleship_1_desc:0 "Following the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was allowed to retain six pre-dreadnought battleships. Classified as Linienschiffe (Ships of the Line) by the Kriegsmarine, only two ships of the Deutschland Class, not to be confused with the later Deutschland-class Pocket Battleships, remained in active service through the 1930s. At 04:47 on September 1, 1939, Schleswig-Holstein fired the first shots of World War II as she opened fire on the Westerplatte base in Danzig, Poland."
 GER_battleship_2:0 "Scharnhorst Class"
 GER_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."
 GER_battleship_3:0 "Bismarck Class"
 GER_battleship_3_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15") guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."

 JAP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Tajima class was a hypothetical class of fast battleships, designed to be cheaper and faster to build than the massive Yamato class battleships. They utilized the older cannons of previous battleships, but high speed, adequate armor and AA provided the defense for these ships."
 JAP_battleship_4:0 "Iwami Class"
 JAP_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Iwami class was a hypothetical class of battleships, that utilized new methods to speed up construction. They were well-armed with new cannons and heavy AA guns, and could match any similarly armed vessels for firepower. However, the resulting improvements meant a heavier and thus somewhat slower class of ships."
 JAP_carrier_1:0 "Kaga Class"
 JAP_carrier_1_desc:0 "The aircraft carrier Kaga was Japan's first fleet carrier. She was originally a battleship, but finished as an aircraft carrier. This resulted in a large and heavily armored carrier with limited space for improvement. However, it was an important experience in aircraft carrier construction for the Imperial Japanese Navy."
 JAP_carrier_2:0 "Soryu Class"
 JAP_carrier_2_desc:0 "Soryu and Hiryu were designed with mirrored island superstructure to speed up aircraft recovery processes while sailing next to each other. They were fast carriers with room for large air groups, but minimally armored. They displaced 20.000tons and large engines provided high speed and a long range of operations."
 JAP_carrier_3:0 "Shokaku Class"
 JAP_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Shokaku class aircraft carriers were designed for high speed, long radius of action, heavy protection and a large aircraft capacity, which made them excellent carriers. Due to the improved construction methods, they displaced 33.000tons full load, and could survive more damage than most contemporary carriers."
 JAP_carrier_4:0 "Taiho Class"
 JAP_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Taiho class aircraft carrier was the IJN's first fully armored carriers, with an armored flight deck to withstand multiple bomb and torpedo hits and still function effectively. A large air group together AND heavy AA armament would provide not just self-defense but also force projection over enemy forces."
 JAP_destroyer_1:0 "Minekaze Class"
 JAP_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Minekaze, Kamikaze, and Mutsuki class destroyers were well-armed both with surface guns and torpedoes for their time but had limited AA weaponry. They were considered obsolete at the start of WWII and relegated to mostly secondary roles."
 JAP_destroyer_2:0 "Asashio Class"
 JAP_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Asashio class destroyers was the first Japanese destroyer class to exceed 2,000 tons displacement and the first to be equipped with sonar. They had heavy torpedo weaponry and adequate light AA guns, and a slightly larger operational radius than the older Fubuki class."
 JAP_destroyer_3:0 "Akizuki Class"
 JAP_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Akizuki class destroyers were well-armed with both surface guns and torpedoes, adequate AA armament, as well as much needed extra depth charges. Out of the 39 planned only 12 were completed before the series was cancelled."
 JAP_destroyer_4:0 "Shimakaze Class"
 JAP_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Shimakaze class was the fastest destroyer in the world at the time of its completion. It was a prototype destroyer to test out new high-temperature, high-pressure turbines. It was extremely fast and heavily armed with torpedoes, but this meant a smaller radius of operations."
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Furutaka Class"
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Furutaka-class and the following Aoba class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the Imperial Japanese Navy. They were designed the US Omaha and British Hawkins class as templates. Later in their life they were modernized and received new armaments and better engines."
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Heavy Mogami Class"
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The heavy Mogami class was an up-gunned and reclassified light cruiser class. This made them fast, heavily armed and well-armored cruisers. Their long range came at the cost of, thinner armor protection."
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Tone Class"
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Tone class heavy cruisers were originally designed as light cruisers, but revisioned with heavier armaments. They were unique in that all armaments were positioned forward, while the aft part of the ship was used to carry and service float-planes that scouted for enemy forces."
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Ibuki Class"
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Ibuki-class heavy cruisers were the last cruisers to be built by Japan before the end of the war. They were improved versions of the Mogami class heavy cruisers, featuring the same layout and armament but with more modern AA weaponry and engines."
 JAP_light_cruiser_1:0 "Tenryu Class"
 JAP_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Tenryu class ships displaced around 4,400 tons and were lightly armed compared to the similar vessels of other navies, but good speed and adequate torpedo armament made up for these shortcomings. They were designed to act as flagships for destroyer flotillas, and thus considered an intermediate class between the light cruiser and the destroyer."
 JAP_light_cruiser_2:0 "Light Mogami Class"
 JAP_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Mogami class cruisers were heavily armed, equipped with good armor and strong engines that provided high speed. They were up-gunned from their original design and reclassified as heavy cruisers. The good AA defense and high speed ensured a long range of operations."
 JAP_light_cruiser_3:0 "Agano Class"
 JAP_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Agano-class light cruisers were designed primarily as flottila leaders for destroyer squadrons. They were fast, armed with 3 twin 152mm guns, but limited AA armaments and thin armor plates were major drawbacks of the design."
 JAP_light_cruiser_4:0 "Agatsuma Class"
 JAP_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Agatsuma class was light cruiser class that never saw any ships built before the end of the war. The cruisers were designed to be fast and heavily armed but light-armored, to protect the fleets and carriers against enemy aircraft."
 JAP_SH_battleship_1:0 "Yamato Class"
 JAP_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Yamato class consisted of the heaviest battleships ever created, displacing 72,000 tons, and the ships were designed to be the pride and might of the Japanese navy under the Peace Goddesses plan. Each ship carried nine 460-millimetre naval guns, the largest naval artillery ever fitted to a warship."
 JAP_SH_battleship_2:0 "Super Yamato Class"
 JAP_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The hypothetical Super Yamato class saw the Yamato was used as a base, but the weapons would be even stronger with a main armament of 51cm cannons and a strong AA armament of the newest type. Their armor thickness was designed to withstand even shells from its own cannons, and they would displace around 70-80.000tons."
 JAP_submarine_1:0 "Kaichu Class"
 JAP_submarine_1_desc:0 "The kaichu class submarines were built after WWI and based on the earlier submarines. These medium-sized submarines were adequately armed, possesses good operational range and had good speed for their time, but by 1938 they were somewhat outdated. Altogether 42 Kaichu type submarines were built for the IJN and the series included 7 variants."
 JAP_submarine_2:0 "Kaidai VI Class"
 JAP_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Kaidai VI class submarines were large and well-armed submarines with long range and relatively good speed. The entire Kaidai series of submarines were stable and successful boats which served the IJN until the Pacific War ended."
 JAP_submarine_3:0 "Ko/Otsu/Hei-gata Class"
 JAP_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Ko-gata, Otsu-gata, and Hei-gata class boats were large-sized cruiser submarines which served as command ships for submarine squadrons. They were equipped with sophisticated radio equipment, heavy torpedo armament and their larger sizes meant a large operational radius. The Ko and Otsu-gata classes carried float-planes as well for scouting role."
 JAP_submarine_4:0 "Sen-Toku Class"
 JAP_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Sen-Toku class submarines were the largest submersibles of WWII. They were submarine aircraft carriers with heavy torpedo armament, adequate light AA and, due to their size and engines, relatively fast and long-ranged. They were able to carry three Aichi M6A Seiran aircraft for scouting and limited striking abilities."
 LAT_submarine_1:0 "Ronis Class"
 LAT_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Ronis class consisted of two submarines built in France for the Latvian Navy. They were commissioned in 1927. They were small, displacing only 390 tons, and were armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes."
 NOR_destroyer_1:0 "Draug Class"
 NOR_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The four Draug-class destroyers were the first multi-vessel class of destroyers built for the Royal Norwegian Navy. They were commissioned just before World War I and displaced 580 tons. They were armed with three 3 in. British QF guns in their main armament. They were fairly slow, however, even compared to other destroyers of their vintage."
 NOR_destroyer_2:0 "Sleipner Class"
 NOR_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Sleipner class was a class of large torpedo boats built in Norway for the Royal Norwegian Navy and commissioned between 1937 and 1939. Unlike the earlier Draug class, the Sleipner class had relatively good armament and ASW equipment. The displaced 735 tons and had decent speed for their size."
 NOR_destroyer_3:0 "Ålesund Class"
 NOR_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Ålesund class consisted of two destroyers laid down in 1939 but never completed before the German occupation. Had they been completed, they would have been the first Norwegian destroyers that were comparable in size to the destroyers of most major nations, displacing over 1,200 tons. They were to be armed with four 120mm/40 Bofors cannon in their armament and four 533mm torpedo tubes."
 NOR_destroyer_4:0 "Stord Class"
 NOR_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Stord class consisted of four British S-class destroyers built for the Royal Norwegian Navy in exile between 1943 and 1944. They displaced nearly 1,800 tons and were armed with four 120mm/45 QF Mk IX guns in their main armament, as well as eight 533mm torpedo tubes and a decent ASW and radar complement. They also had good speed and reliability as well."
 NOR_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Norge Class"
 NOR_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Norge was a coastal defense ship built for Norway in Britain at the turn of the century. Its armament, which centered around two 210mm guns, was comparable to a heavy cruiser, though its size, which displaced just over 4,200 tons, was closer to a light cruiser. Its speed was comparable to a dreadnought battleship. It was one of four coastal defense ships of its era that was still serving the Royal Norwegian Navy at the start of World War II."
 NOR_submarine_1:0 "B Class"
 NOR_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Norwegian B-class submarines were American Holland-type subs built in Norway for the Norwegian Navy. The six ships of the class were commissioned between 1923 and 1930. They displaced 420 tons, were armed with four 450mm torpedo tubes, and had a diving depth of 60m."
 NOR_submarine_3:0 "Uredd Class"
 NOR_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Uredd class consisted of two British U-class submarines built for the Norwegian Navy in exile between 1941 and 1943. The ships displaced 540 tons and were armed with four 533mm torpedo tubes. They had a good complement of British radar and sonar, and a diving depth of 60m."
 NOR_submarine_4:0 "Utsira Class"
 NOR_submarine_4_desc:0 "KThe Utsira class consisted of four British Vampire-class submarines. They were built between 1943 and 1944, though only one was transferred to the Norwegian Navy in exile before the end of the war. The ships were only a moderate improvement over the preceding U-class. They displaced 545 tons, were armed with four 533mm torpedo tubes, and a diving depth of 90m."
 NZL_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 NZL_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 NZL_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 NZL_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 NZL_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 NZL_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 NZL_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 NZL_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 NZL_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 NZL_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 NZL_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 NZL_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 NZL_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 NZL_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 NZL_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 NZL_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 NZL_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 NZL_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range. "
 NZL_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 NZL_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 NZL_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 NZL_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 NZL_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 NZL_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes was the same as in the F class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 NZL_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 NZL_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 NZL_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 NZL_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 NZL_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 NZL_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
 NZL_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 NZL_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 NZL_light_cruiser_3:0 "Gambia Class"
 NZL_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Gambia class was the New Zeland designation for British Crown Colony-class light cruisers. These were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 NZL_light_cruiser_4:0 "Black Prince Class"
 NZL_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Black Prince class was the Canadian designation for British Minotaur-class (or Swiftsure-class) light cruisers. These cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 NZL_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 NZL_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 NZL_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 NZL_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 NZL_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 NZL_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 NZL_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 NZL_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 NZL_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 NZL_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 NZL_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 NZL_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 PRU_destroyer_1:0 "Almirante Villar Class"
 PRU_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Almirante Villar and Amirante Guise were two former Russian Novik-class destroyers. They had a roundabout path to the Peruvian Navy, sailing under the flags of both the U.K. and Estonia before finally being delivered to Peru in 1934. They were armed with four 102mm/60 caliber guns and nine 533mm torpedo tubes. They displaced over 1,200 tons and had decent speed for their size and vintage."
 PRU_light_cruiser_1:0 "Almirante Grau Class"
 PRU_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Almirante Grau class consisted of two pre-WWI light cruisers built in Britain for the Peruvian Navy and commissioned in 1907. Even for a light cruiser, the ships were fairly small, displacing only 3,100 tons, and had below-average speed as well. They were lightly armored and had twin 152mm/50 caliber Vickers guns as their main armament."
 PRU_submarine_1:0 "R Class"
 PRU_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Peruvian R-class submarines consisted of four subs ordered from and built by the U.S. in the mid-1920s. They were essentially identical to the U.S. R-class submarines, displacing over 570 tons and armed with four 533mm torpedo tubes."
 SOV_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Borodino Class"
 SOV_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorized in 1914, just before WWI. They were based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of WWI and the Russian Revolution doomed these ships from ever being finished."
 SOV_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Kronshtadt Class"
 SOV_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kronshtadt class (Project 69) battlecruisers were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on German Scharnhorst battlecruisers arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons. As hostilities broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, the ships construction was halted and eventually cancelled. Alternative plans called for finishing the incomplete hulls as aircraft carriers under Project 69AV."
 SOV_battleship_1:0 "Marat Class"
 SOV_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
 SOV_battleship_2:0 "Project 21"
 SOV_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 21 battleships were designed in the mid 1930's to be part of Stalin's Ocean-Going Navy. They would be very similar to the British Nelson-class battleships. The ships would displace around 41,000 tons, would be armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets (all forward), and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armor provided a strong defense against air and surface targets. The project was eventually cancelled but part of its elements were used in the Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) battleships."
 SOV_battleship_3:0 "Lenin class"
 SOV_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lenin-class battleship was a hypothetical design to match and counter the German Bismarck and U.S. South Dakota class battleships. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets would provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armor, and large engines would ensure its survival in battle."
 SOV_battleship_4:0 "Stalingrad Class"
 SOV_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Stalingrad class (Project 82) capital ships were intended to provide the Soviet navy with its primary firepower in the post WWII era. They were fast, well-armed, and well-armored vessels. Construction started after the war, but the death of Josif Stalin led to the cancellation of these ships, though there were projects to finish at least one as a modified design equipped with Soviet V-2 missiles."
 SOV_carrier_1:0 "Ismail Class"
 SOV_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ismail class aircraft carrier was the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship would have a thick armor belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group would provide her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out due to costs and the state of the Soviet shipbuilding industry after the October Revolution."
 SOV_carrier_2:0 "Krasnyi Vozdukh"
 SOV_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Vozdukh-class aircraft carrier was a hypothetical design to provide the Soviet navy air projection over its fleets. They were similar in size to the British Ark Royal or Japanese Hiryu classes but carried additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armor results in a slightly reduced air group compared to these classes."
 SOV_carrier_3:0 "Project 71B"
 SOV_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Project 71B carriers were designed in the mid-to-late 1930's. They were planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets Stalin ordered in his plan. Two ships were planned that would displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armor, and an adequate air group. The German invasion caused the cancellation of construction for these vessels."
 SOV_carrier_4:0 "Project 72"
 SOV_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Project 72 aircraft carriers were the improved versions of the previous Project 71 ships. Design studies finished in the early 1940's resulting in a larger ship with thinner armor. The extra space was used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."
 SOV_destroyer_1:0 "Orfey Class"
 SOV_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey class destroyers were an improved version of the previous Novik class. They featured adequate surface and AA armament for their size, somewhat short range, but good speed and heavy torpedo armament. The succeeding Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes were further improved versions of this class with increased main armament and hull size."
 SOV_destroyer_2:0 "Gnevny Class"
 SOV_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny class (Project 7) destroyers were authorized under the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The class itself was heavily influenced by the Italian destroyer Maestrale and considered a successful design. Their displacement were in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they were well-armed and they had adequate AA and torpedo armament. Due to the powerful engines they were fast but short-ranged vessels."
 SOV_destroyer_3:0 "Soobrazitelnyi Class"
 SOV_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi (Project 7U) destroyers were an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines were redesigned and they had a stronger AA armament. They displaced between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range were similar to the Gnevny class."
 SOV_destroyer_4:0 "Skoryi Class"
 SOV_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class (Project 30bis) was a further improvement on the Ognevoy class. The increase in size and displacement (2,500-3,100 tons) resulted in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships were built after the War to a modular design that resulted in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament was the same as that of the previous Ognevoy class, but the main guns were housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Krasniy Kavkaz Class"
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because she was a rebuilt light cruiser, her armor was thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Kirov Class"
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers were the Soviet Navy's first modern cruisers. The design was based on the Italian Raimondo Montecuccoli class light cruisers and was built as part of the 1933-1938 shipbuilding program. The ships displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They were armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provided good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armor belt was thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Project 22"
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Project 22 heavy cruisers were designed in the mid 1930's to counter similar vessels in neighboring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They were equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defense, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks would be to scout for enemy forces and convoy hunting. The cost of the ships and the allocation of resources to other needs resulted in the cancellation of the project."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Project 66"
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Project 66 heavy cruisers were the Soviet Navy's last attempt to design and build a purely gun cruiser. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged after the war. The vessels would feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement would be at least 26,500 tons. The advent of the missile age and the death of Josef Stalin caused the project to be terminated."
 SOV_light_cruiser_1:0 "Krasniy Krym Class"
 SOV_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasniy Krym class cruiser, originally the Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned into the Soviet Navy along with her half-sister Chervona Ukraina (ex Admiral Nakhimov). These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for their time."
 SOV_light_cruiser_2:0 "Komsomolets Class"
 SOV_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Komsomolets class light cruisers were series of hypothetical vessels. They were somewhat of a mix of older and new technologies. Using the incomplete hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer caliber guns and adequate AA armament they were suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities to the Kirov class cruisers."
 SOV_light_cruiser_3:0 "Chapayev Class"
 SOV_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Chapayev class (Project 68) cruisers were based on the Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers and authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. As the first true light cruisers of the Soviet navy, they carried a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with an adequate torpedo armament. Overall, these were good ships with a thick armor belt, high speed, a good operational range, and a displacement of 10,500 to 14,000 tons. Due to the war and the invasion of the German forces, many ships of the class were cancelled and the rest were finished after the hostilities ended."
 SOV_light_cruiser_4:0 "Sverdlov Class"
 SOV_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Sverdlov class cruisers (Project 68bis) were the last gun cruisers of the Soviet Navy and were improved versions of the preceding Chapayev class. Compared to the Chapayevs, they had the same main armament, machinery and armor protection, but had increased fuel capacity for greater range, improved underwater protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and slightly better seaworthiness. They were designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts. Due to the advent of the missile age, many ships were cancelled or not finished."
 SOV_SH_battleship_1:0 "Sovetsky Soyuz Class"
 SOV_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) was the last class of battleships built by the Soviet shipyards and were authorized in the 1938-43 shipbuilding program. Four ships were planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also had strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armor. The outbreak of the war prevented these ships from being completed."
 SOV_SH_battleship_2:0 "Project 23bis"
 SOV_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 23bis-class battleships were a modified and improved version of the previous Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23). Compared to their predecessors, they carried four triple turrets of the same 406mm caliber cannons, thickened belt armor, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament."
 SOV_submarine_1:0 "AG Class"
 SOV_submarine_1_desc:0 "Amerikansky Golland (American Holland) class submarines were built in Canada, then delivered to Russia during WWI, where they were finally assembled. They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
 SOV_submarine_2:0 "Series V Shchuka"
 SOV_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Series V submarines of the Schuka class were the second-most numerous submarines of the Soviet Navy. Their large number came from their deployment to the four fleets of the Soviet Union: Black Sea, Baltic, Northern and Pacific. They were medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness."
 SOV_submarine_3:0 "Series XIV K-Class"
 SOV_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Series XIV submarines were large cruising submarines with extended range. They were essentially an improved version of the Series IV Pravda class. These submarines featured heavy armament of both surface guns and torpedoes. They had a long range but only satisfactory seaworthiness."
 SOV_submarine_4:0 "Project 611"
 SOV_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Project 611 submarines (NATO Codename: Zulu), were the Soviet Navy's first submarine class to be built after WWII. Their design was based on the German Type XXI submarines, and they were meant to replace the older Series XIV K class boats. They were large, ocean-going submarines with a heavy torpedo armament and long range. They were used as a basis for the follow-up Project 613 (NATO Codename: Whiskey) and Project 641 (NATO Codename: Foxtrot) class submarines."
 USA_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Lexington Class"
 USA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class was initially a reaction to Japan's Kongo class battlecruiser. Ordered by the Naval Act of 1916, the ships were intended to carry 16" guns in dual turrets and be capable of 33 knots. After construction began, the US entered into the Washington Naval Treaty and the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga was converted to Carriers."
 USA_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Alaska Class"
 USA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Alaska Class was a response to the German pocket battleships now more so to Japan's "super cruisers." Designed to carry 12" guns and handle up to 10" shell fire, the class was capable of cruiser speeds but sacrificed under water protection."
 USA_battleship_1:0 "New York Class"
 USA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The New York Class battleships were the first US Battleships to be armed with the 14"/45 caliber main guns. Numerous 5"/51 guns provided secondary armament and over 10" of armor."
 USA_battleship_2:0 "North Carolina Class"
 USA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The North Carolina Class was a challenging design and was the first battleship class built by the US Navy in 20 years. The US Navy required this class to meet the standards of Washington Naval Treaty, limited to 36,000 tons yet be armed with the 16"/45 caliber guns and have improved armor while being capable of escorting the US Navy's fast aircraft carriers."
 USA_battleship_3:0 "Iowa Class"
 USA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Iowa Class added all the innovations and capabilities of the earlier North Carolina, but substantially increases its displacement and tactical speed. The Iowa's was primarily responsible for escorting carriers groups and was designed with a second role of "cruiser killer" in mind."
 USA_battleship_4:0 "Illinois Class"
 USA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armor. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16"/50 caliber guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements to maximize AA capabilities."
 USA_carrier_1:0 "Lexington Class"
 USA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class carrier was born from the converted hulls of two Lexington Class battlecruisers in order to conform to the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. The class was the first operational carrier class in the US Navy and spent several years improving carrier operations."
 USA_carrier_2:0 "Ranger Class"
 USA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ranger Class was the first US Navy class designed as a carrier from the keel up. As part of a US Navy smaller carrier concept the class was much smaller than the previous Lexington Class, yet still retained the same air group compliment thanks to improvements on interior designs."
 USA_carrier_3:0 "Essex Class"
 USA_carrier_3_desc:0 "With the lessons learned from the preceding Lexington, Ranger and Yorktown variant classes, the result was the Essex Class, a fast ship able to carry a large compliment of planes into battle. Damage control designs would also be carried over from the Yorktown class and a deck edge elevator was included to improve plane handling."
 USA_carrier_4:0 "Midway Class"
 USA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Midway Class was the ultimate in US Navy carrier capability. Implementing an armored deck and able to carry far more aircraft than previous classes, the Midway Class was being given a unique sub-class designation, CVB (Carrier Vessel Battle)."
 USA_destroyer_1:0 "Clemson Class"
 USA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Clemson Class destroyer continued with many design elements of its immediate predecessor, the Wickes Class. The Clemson had improved sea handling over the Wickes Class and was armed with 4"/50 caliber main guns, a 3"/23 caliber AA gun and 12 torpedo tubes. The class was aging and was nearly obsolete, but still comprised the bulk of the US Navy's Destroyer force."
 USA_destroyer_2:0 "Sims Class"
 USA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Sims Class was the largest "1500 Tonner" design with a more streamlined torpedo arrangement and longer hull. Improvement in fire control granted better attack capabilities with its 5"/38 caliber guns and included 12 centerline torpedo tubes."
 USA_destroyer_3:0 "Fletcher Class"
 USA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Fletcher Class represented a large step forward in terms of destroyer capability, thanks largely to its increase to 2500 tons. While keeping the 5"/38 dual purpose guns and centerline torpedo arrangement, the class added an additional single turret and received significant increases in AA weaponry as well as improved range and larger displacement."
 USA_destroyer_4:0 "Allen M Sumner Class"
 USA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Sumner Class continued on the Fletcher Class with displacement only marginally increased. The ship was able to take on more armament gaining dual 5"/38 caliber guns and a much larger compliment of AA weaponry. The addition of a second rudder allowed for improve maneuvering during ASW operations."
 USA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Pensacola Class"
 USA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Pensacola Class were designed under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, and sought to maximize firepower under the 8" gun restriction. It was armed with a formidable armament of 10 x 8"/55 guns. The hull armor was thin and the design was top heavy but capable. It formed the bulk of the US Navy's Heavy Cruiser force."
 USA_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Wichita Class"
 USA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Wichita Class ships improved armament over the Pensacola Class and its variants with a new turret design for its 8"55 caliber guns and improved the fields of fire for its secondary armament of 5"/38 guns. "
 USA_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Baltimore Class"
 USA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Baltimore Class brought together the more successful elements of previous cruiser designs and was based largely off of the Brooklyn Class light cruiser married with configurations with armament and armor from the USS Wichita."
 USA_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Oregon City Class"
 USA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Oregon City Class cruisers provided broad and marginal improvements over the Baltimore Class. Most notably was the change in the super structure which allowed better fields of AA fire. Similar improvements were also found from the Cleveland to the Oregon City class light cruisers."
 USA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Omaha Class"
 USA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Omaha Class was initially designed to fill a key scouting role in the US Navy's WW1 fleet. A fast and capable class, the Omaha Class was armed with a formidable load out of 6"/53 caliber guns in an 8x1 and 2x2 turret configuration and six torpedo launchers. The Omaha Class was aging but comprised of the bulk of the US Navy's Light Cruiser force."
 USA_light_cruiser_2:0 "Brooklyn Class"
 USA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Brooklyn Class was designed with the Washington Naval Treaty in mind and so was restricted to 6" guns. To maximize firepower, the Brooklyn's was armed with 15 of the new Mk16 6" guns in triple turrets. The overall design was very balanced and was considered as the basis of all future cruiser designs for the US Navy."
 USA_light_cruiser_3:0 "Cleveland Class"
 USA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Cleveland Class was based on the Brooklyn Class, but without the Washington Naval Treaty restrictions. The Cleveland Class keeps the 15 6" main gun arrangement, but increased its secondary 5" armament greatly and added additional AA weaponry."
 USA_light_cruiser_4:0 "Fargo Class"
 USA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Fargo Class improved on the successful Cleveland Class. It offered improved fields of AA fire thanks to a better designed pyramid-shaped superstructure."
 USA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Virginia Class"
 USA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "In 1920 the construction of the large South Dakota Class battleships fielding 12 x 16"/50 guns started. The class would have ushered in a new era in heavy battleship design but was cancelled in 1922 to conform to the Washington Naval Treaty. With the Treaty no longer in effect and the threat of a secret Japanese battleship project we can modernize the design, increase displacement to over 55,000 tons and up gun the design with 18"/50 caliber guns to create a new class of heavy battleship."
 USA_SH_battleship_2:0 "Montana Class"
 USA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Montana Class was bigger and more armored than the Illinois Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18"/50 caliber guns and with our latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6" guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements."
 USA_submarine_1:0 "S Class"
 USA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The S boats, commonly known as Sugar Boats, were a series of 51 submarines design and built in the 1920s. Over the WW1 era O & R Boat series, the S Boats were larger allowing longer range and more torpedo reloads even though the class only had four forward-facing 21 inch tubes. Despite their age, with the last S Boat to be commissioned in 1924, the S Boats comprise a significant portion of the US Navy's standing Submarine force."
 USA_submarine_2:0 "Porpoise Class"
 USA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Porpoise Class submarine was the US Navy's first modern submarine designed and built following a series of experimental "V Boats" built in the late 20s and early 30s. Despite initial issues with the all-electric propulsion, the class held promise and was being considered as future designs. The class was armed with 6 torpedo tubes and a 3" deck gun."
 USA_submarine_3:0 "Tambor Class"
 USA_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Tambor class was the culmination of years of US Naval experimentation of both Submarine design to fit the role of "Fleet Boat" and perform well in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Armament was upgraded to 10 torpedo tubes with four firing aft, 3" deck gun with two AA guns for additional protection."
 USA_submarine_4:0 "Balao Class"
 USA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Balao Class was a continuation of the design rooted in the Tambor class. Improvements came in the form of hull reinforcement and upgrading the deck gun to a 5"/24 caliber along with numerous subtle design improvements."

 EGY_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 EGY_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 EGY_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 EGY_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 EGY_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 EGY_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 EGY_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 EGY_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 EGY_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 EGY_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 EGY_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 EGY_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 EGY_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 EGY_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 EGY_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 EGY_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 EGY_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 EGY_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 EGY_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 EGY_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 EGY_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 EGY_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 EGY_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 EGY_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 EGY_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 EGY_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 EGY_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 EGY_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 EGY_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 EGY_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 EGY_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 EGY_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 EGY_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 EGY_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 EGY_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 EGY_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 EGY_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 EGY_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 EGY_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 EGY_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 EGY_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 EGY_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 EGY_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 EGY_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 EGY_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 EGY_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 EGY_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 EGY_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 EGY_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 EGY_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 EGY_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 EGY_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 EGY_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 EGY_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 EGY_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 EGY_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 MAL_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 MAL_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 MAL_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 MAL_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 MAL_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 MAL_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 MAL_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 MAL_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 MAL_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 MAL_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 MAL_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 MAL_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 MAL_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 MAL_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 MAL_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 MAL_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 MAL_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 MAL_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 MAL_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 MAL_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 MAL_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 MAL_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 MAL_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 MAL_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 MAL_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 MAL_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 MAL_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 MAL_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 MAL_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 MAL_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 MAL_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 MAL_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 MAL_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 MAL_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 MAL_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 MAL_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 MAL_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 MAL_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 MAL_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 MAL_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 MAL_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."

She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 NIG_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 NIG_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 NIG_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 NIG_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 NIG_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 NIG_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 NIG_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 NIG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 NIG_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 NIG_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 NIG_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 NIG_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 NIG_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 NIG_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 NIG_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 NIG_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 NIG_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 NIG_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 NIG_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 NIG_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 NIG_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 NIG_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 NIG_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 NIG_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 NIG_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 NIG_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 NIG_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 NIG_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 NIG_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 NIG_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 NIG_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 NIG_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 NIG_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 NIG_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 NIG_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 NIG_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 NIG_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 NIG_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 NIG_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 NIG_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 LEE_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 LEE_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 LEE_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 LEE_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 LEE_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 LEE_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 LEE_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 LEE_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 LEE_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 LEE_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 LEE_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 LEE_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 LEE_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 LEE_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."

They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 WIN_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 WIN_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 WIN_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 WIN_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 WIN_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 WIN_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 WIN_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 WIN_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 WIN_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 WIN_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 WIN_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 WIN_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 WIN_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 WIN_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 WIN_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 WIN_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 WIN_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 WIN_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 BEZ_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 BEZ_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 BEZ_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 BEZ_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 BEZ_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 BEZ_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 BEZ_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 BEZ_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 BEZ_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 BEZ_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 BEZ_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 BEZ_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 BEZ_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 BEZ_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 BEZ_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 BEZ_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 BEZ_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 BEZ_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 BEZ_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 BEZ_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 BEZ_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 BEZ_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 BEZ_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 BEZ_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 BEZ_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 BEZ_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 BEZ_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 BEZ_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 BEZ_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 BEZ_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 BEZ_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 BEZ_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 BEZ_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 BEZ_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 BEZ_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 BEZ_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "

 GAM_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 GAM_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 GAM_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 GAM_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 GAM_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 GAM_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 GAM_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 GAM_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 GAM_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 GAM_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 GAM_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 GAM_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 GAM_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 GAM_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 GAM_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 GAM_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 GAM_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 GAM_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 GAM_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 GAM_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 GAM_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 GAM_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 GAM_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 GAM_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 GAM_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 GAM_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 GAM_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 GAM_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 GAM_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 GAM_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 GAM_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 GAM_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 GAM_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 GAM_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 GAM_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 GAM_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 GAM_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 GAM_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 GAM_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 GAM_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 GAM_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 GAM_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 GAM_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 GAM_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 GAM_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 GAM_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 GAM_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 GAM_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 GAM_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 GAM_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 GAM_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 KEN_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 KEN_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 KEN_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 KEN_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."

 LES_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 LES_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 LES_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 LES_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 LES_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 LES_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 LES_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 LES_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 LES_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 LES_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 LES_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 LES_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 LES_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 LES_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 LES_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 LES_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 LES_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 LES_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 LES_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 LES_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 LES_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 LES_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 LES_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 LES_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 LES_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 LES_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 LES_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 LES_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 LES_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 GHA_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 GHA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 GHA_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 GHA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 GHA_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 GHA_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 GHA_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 GHA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 GHA_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 GHA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 GHA_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 GHA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 GHA_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 GHA_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 GHA_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 GHA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 GHA_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 GHA_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 GHA_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 GHA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 GHA_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 GHA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 GHA_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 GHA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 GHA_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 GHA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."

They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 FAL_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 FAL_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 FAL_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 FAL_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 FAL_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 FAL_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 SRI_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 SRI_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 SRI_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 SRI_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 SRI_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 SRI_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 SRI_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 SRI_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 SRI_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 SRI_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 SRI_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 SRI_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 SRI_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 SRI_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 SRI_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 SRI_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 SRI_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 SRI_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 SRI_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 SRI_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 SRI_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 SRI_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 SRI_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 SRI_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 SRI_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 SRI_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 SRI_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 SRI_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 SRI_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 SRI_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 SRI_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 SRI_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 SRI_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 SRI_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 SRI_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 SRI_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 SRI_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 SRI_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 SRI_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 SRI_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 SRI_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 SRI_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 SRI_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 SRI_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 SRI_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 SRI_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 SRI_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 SRI_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."

 BAR_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 BAR_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 BAR_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 BAR_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 BAR_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 BAR_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 BAR_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 BAR_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 BAR_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 BAR_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 BAR_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 BAR_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 BAR_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 BAR_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 BAR_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 BAR_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 BAR_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 BAR_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 BAR_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 BAR_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 BAR_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 BAR_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 BAR_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 BAR_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 BAR_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 BAR_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 BAR_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 BAR_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 BAR_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 BAR_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 BAR_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 BAR_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 BAR_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 BAR_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 BAR_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 BAR_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 BAR_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 BAR_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 BAR_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 BAR_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 BAH_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 BAH_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 BAH_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 BAH_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 BAH_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 BAH_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 BAH_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 BAH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 BAH_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 BAH_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 BAH_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 BAH_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 BAH_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 BAH_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 BAH_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"

 JAM_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 JAM_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 JAM_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 JAM_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 JAM_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 JAM_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 JAM_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 JAM_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 JAM_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 JAM_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 JAM_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 JAM_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 JAM_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 JAM_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 JAM_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 JAM_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 JAM_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 TNT_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 TNT_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 TNT_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 TNT_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 TNT_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 TNT_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 TNT_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 TNT_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 TNT_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 TNT_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 TNT_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 TNT_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 TNT_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 TNT_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 TNT_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 TNT_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 TNT_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 TNT_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 TNT_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 TNT_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 TNT_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 TNT_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 TNT_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 TNT_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 TNT_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 TNT_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 TNT_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 TNT_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 TNT_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 TNT_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 TNT_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 TNT_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 TNT_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 TNT_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 TNT_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 TNT_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 TNT_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 TNT_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."

Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 KON_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 KON_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 KON_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 KON_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 KON_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 KON_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 KON_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 KON_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 KON_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 KON_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 KON_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 KON_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 KON_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 KON_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 KON_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 KON_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 KON_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 KON_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 KON_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 KON_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 KON_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 KON_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 KON_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 KON_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 KON_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 KON_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 KON_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 KON_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 KON_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 KON_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 KON_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 KON_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 KON_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 KON_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 KON_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 KON_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 KON_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 KON_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 KON_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 KON_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 KON_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 KON_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 KON_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 KON_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 KON_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 KON_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 KON_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 KON_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 BRU_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 BRU_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 BRU_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 BRU_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 BRU_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 BRU_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 BRU_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 BRU_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships.

 JOR_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 JOR_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 JOR_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 JOR_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 JOR_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 JOR_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 JOR_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 JOR_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 JOR_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 JOR_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 JOR_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 JOR_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 JOR_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 JOR_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 JOR_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 JOR_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 JOR_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 JOR_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 JOR_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 JOR_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 JOR_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 JOR_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 JOR_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 JOR_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 JOR_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 JOR_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 JOR_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 CYP_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 CYP_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 CYP_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 CYP_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 CYP_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 CYP_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 CYP_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 CYP_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 CYP_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 CYP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 CYP_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 CYP_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 CYP_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 CYP_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 CYP_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 CYP_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 CYP_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 CYP_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 CYP_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 CYP_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 CYP_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 CYP_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 CYP_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 CYP_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 CYP_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 CYP_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 CYP_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 CYP_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs.

 GIB_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 GIB_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 GIB_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 MAT_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 MAT_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 MAT_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 MAT_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 MAT_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 MAT_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 MAT_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 MAT_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 MAT_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 MAT_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 MAT_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 MAT_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 MAT_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 MAT_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 MAT_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 MAT_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 MAT_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 MAT_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 MAT_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 MAT_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 MAT_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 MAT_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 MAT_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 MAT_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 MAT_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 MAT_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 MAT_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 MAT_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 MAT_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 MAT_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 MAT_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 MAT_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 MAT_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 MAT_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 MAT_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 MAT_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 MAT_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 MAT_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 MAT_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 MAT_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 MAT_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 MAT_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 MAT_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 MAT_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 MAT_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 MAT_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 MAT_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 MAT_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 MAT_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 MAT_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 MAT_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 MAT_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean.

More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 HEL_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 HEL_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 HEL_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 HEL_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 HEL_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 HEL_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 HEL_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 HEL_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 HEL_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 HEL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 HEL_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 HEL_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 HEL_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 HEL_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 HEL_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 HEL_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 HEL_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 HEL_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 HEL_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 HEL_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 HEL_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 HEL_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 HEL_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 HEL_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 HEL_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 HEL_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 HEL_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 HEL_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 HEL_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 HEL_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 HEL_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 HEL_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 HEL_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 HEL_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 HEL_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 HEL_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 MAU_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 MAU_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 MAU_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 MAU_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 MAU_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 MAU_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 MAU_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 MAU_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 MAU_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 MAU_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 MAU_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 MAU_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 MAU_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 MAU_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 MAU_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 MAU_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 MAU_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 MAU_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 MAU_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"

The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 SEY_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 SEY_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 SEY_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 SEY_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 SEY_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 SEY_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 SEY_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 SEY_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 SEY_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 SEY_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 SEY_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 SEY_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 SEY_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 SEY_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 BWP_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 BWP_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 BWP_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 BWP_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 BWP_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 BWP_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 BWP_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 BWP_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 BWP_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 BWP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 BWP_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 BWP_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 BWP_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 BWP_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 BWP_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 BWP_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 BWP_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 BWP_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 BWP_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 BWP_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 BWP_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 BWP_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 BWP_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 BWP_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 BWP_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 BWP_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 BWP_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 BWP_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 BWP_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 BWP_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 BWP_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 BWP_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 BWP_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 BWP_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 BWP_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 BWP_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 BWP_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 BWP_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 BWP_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 BWP_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."

 SAR_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 SAR_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 SAR_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 SAR_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 SAR_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 SAR_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 SAR_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 SAR_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 SAR_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 SAR_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 SAR_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 SAR_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 SAR_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 SAR_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 SAR_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 SAR_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 SAR_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 SAR_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 SAR_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 SAR_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 SAR_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 SAR_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 SAR_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 SAR_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 SAR_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 SAR_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 SAR_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 SAR_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 SAR_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 SAR_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 SAR_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 SAR_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 SAR_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 SAR_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 SAR_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 SAR_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 SAR_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 SAR_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 SAR_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 SAR_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 SAR_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 SAR_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 SAR_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 SAR_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 SAR_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 SAR_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 SAR_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 SOL_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 SOL_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 SOL_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 SOL_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 SOL_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 SOL_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 SOL_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 SOL_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."

 BOT_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 BOT_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 BOT_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 BOT_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 BOT_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 BOT_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 BOT_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 BOT_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 BOT_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 BOT_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 BOT_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 BOT_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 BOT_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 BOT_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 BOT_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 BOT_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 BOT_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 BOT_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 BOT_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 BOT_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 BOT_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 BOT_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 BOT_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 BOT_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 BOT_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 SUD_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 SUD_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 SUD_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 SUD_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 SUD_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 SUD_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 SUD_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 SUD_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 SUD_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 SUD_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 SUD_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 SUD_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 SUD_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 SUD_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 SUD_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 SUD_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 SUD_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 SUD_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 SUD_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 SUD_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 SUD_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 SUD_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 SUD_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 SUD_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 SUD_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 SUD_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 SUD_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 SUD_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 SUD_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"

Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 TNZ_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 TNZ_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 UGA_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 UGA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 UGA_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 UGA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 UGA_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 UGA_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 UGA_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 UGA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 UGA_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 UGA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 UGA_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 UGA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 UGA_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 UGA_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 UGA_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 UGA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 UGA_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 UGA_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 UGA_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 UGA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 UGA_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 UGA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 UGA_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 UGA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 UGA_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 UGA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 UGA_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 UGA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 UGA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 UGA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 UGA_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 UGA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 UGA_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 UGA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 UGA_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 UGA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 UGA_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 UGA_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 UGA_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 UGA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 UGA_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 UGA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 UGA_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 UGA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 UGA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 UGA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 UGA_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 UGA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 UGA_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 UGA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes.

They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 UGA_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 UGA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean.

 KUW_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 KUW_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 KUW_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 KUW_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 KUW_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 KUW_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 KUW_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 KUW_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 KUW_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 KUW_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 KUW_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 KUW_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 KUW_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 KUW_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 KUW_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 KUW_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 KUW_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 KUW_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 KUW_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 KUW_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 KUW_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 KUW_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 KUW_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 KUW_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 KUW_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 KUW_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 KUW_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 KUW_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 KUW_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 KUW_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 KUW_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 KUW_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 KUW_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 KUW_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 KUW_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 KUW_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 KUW_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 ZAM_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 ZAM_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 ZAM_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 ZAM_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 ZAM_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 ZAM_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 ZAM_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 ZAM_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 ZAM_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 ZAM_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 ZAM_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 ZAM_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 ZAM_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 ZAM_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 ZAM_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 ZAM_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 ZAM_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 ZAM_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."

 MAW_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 MAW_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 MAW_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 MAW_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 MAW_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 MAW_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 MAW_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 MAW_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 MAW_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 MAW_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 MAW_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 MAW_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 MAW_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 MAW_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 MAW_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 MAW_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 MAW_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 UAE_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 UAE_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 UAE_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 UAE_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 UAE_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 UAE_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 UAE_battleship_2:0 "King George V Class"
 UAE_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 UAE_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 UAE_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 UAE_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 UAE_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 UAE_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 UAE_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 UAE_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 UAE_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 UAE_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 UAE_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 UAE_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 UAE_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 UAE_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 UAE_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 UAE_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 UAE_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 UAE_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 UAE_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 UAE_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 UAE_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 UAE_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 UAE_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 UAE_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 UAE_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 UAE_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 UAE_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 UAE_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 UAE_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 UAE_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 UAE_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."

 PAL_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 PAL_battleship_3:0 "Lion Class"
 PAL_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 PAL_battleship_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 PAL_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 PAL_carrier_1:0 "Courageous Class"
 PAL_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 PAL_carrier_2:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 PAL_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 PAL_carrier_3:0 "Illustrious Class"
 PAL_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 PAL_carrier_4:0 "Implacable Class"
 PAL_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 PAL_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 PAL_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 PAL_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 PAL_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 PAL_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 PAL_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 PAL_destroyer_4:0 "Battle Class"
 PAL_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 PAL_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 PAL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 PAL_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 PAL_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 PAL_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 PAL_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 PAL_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 PAL_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 PAL_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 PAL_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 PAL_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 PAL_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 PAL_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 PAL_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 PAL_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 PAL_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 PAL_SH_battleship_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 PAL_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 PAL_SH_battleship_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 PAL_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 PAL_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 PAL_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 PAL_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 PAL_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 PAL_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 PAL_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 PAL_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 PAL_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."

 ENG_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 ENG_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 ENG_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 ENG_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 ENG_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts.

 AOF_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Durand-Viel Design"
 AOF_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 AOF_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Dunkerque Class"
 AOF_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 AOF_battleship_1:0 "Courbet Class"
 AOF_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 AOF_battleship_2:0 "Richelieu Class"
 AOF_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."

 AOF_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."

 AOF_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 AOF_carrier_3:0 "Jean Bart Class"
 AOF_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano.

The heavy AA armament of US origin would provide a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 AOF_carrier_4:0 "Clemenceau Class"
 AOF_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down.

 AOF_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines. They were authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these ships."
 AOF_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Suffren Class"
 AOF_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy; very thin armor but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
 AOF_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Algérie Class"
 AOF_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection is considerably increased. Its AA armament is adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement is over 10,000 tons."
 AOF_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Saint Louis Class"
 AOF_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armor would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
 AOF_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Forbin Class"
 AOF_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Forbin-class heavy cruisers were a hypothetical design as a follow up of the Saint Louis class. Designed to defend the trade lanes between Mainland France and the colonies, it had long range and good speed along with a heavy armament of guns in four triple turrets and an adequate number of AA weaponry. The ship layout and general look resembled an influence from the previous Saint Louis class as well as British Crown Colony class."
 AOF_light_cruiser_1:0 "Duguay-Trouin Class"
 AOF_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duguay-Trouin light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I in the 1922 naval program. They became the first light cruisers with super-firing enclosed main turrets. Among light cruisers, they had a strong torpedo armament but virtually nonexistent armor."
 AOF_light_cruiser_2:0 "La Galissonnière Class"
 AOF_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programs, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
 AOF_light_cruiser_3:0 "De Grasse Class"
 AOF_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 AOF_light_cruiser_4:0 "Colbert Class"
 AOF_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse is that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
 AOF_SH_battleship_1:0 "Charlemagne Class"
 AOF_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships is a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They feature a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armor. The entire design borrows elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
 AOF_SH_battleship_2:0 "Napoléon Bonaparte Class"
 AOF_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament is distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armor and strong engines provide the speed and defense needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
 AOF_submarine_1:0 "600 Series"
 AOF_submarine_1_desc:0 "The 600-ton Series of submarines were France's first modern post WWI submarines. They were medium sized, displacing around 600tons. Though they were seagoing ones, they were designated as coastal submarines and used mostly in warm waters of the Mediterranean. Three classes of 4 ships each built of this type: Sirène, Ariane and Circé classes. They were the basis of the bigger 630-ton Series the Argonaute, Diane and Orion classes."
 AOF_submarine_2:0 "Minerve Class"
 AOF_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardization program resulting of a centralized design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) rather than shipyard specific designs of the previous classes."
 AOF_submarine_3:0 "Roland Morillot Class"
 AOF_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Roland Morillot-class submarines (Project name Z2) were large ocean going submarines based on the earlier Redoubtable-class submarines. They were large submarines displacing 1,800-2,400 tons and carried a formidable armament of 10 torpedo tubes. The Fall of France occurred before any were finished."
 AOF_submarine_4:0 "Phénix Class"
 AOF_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Phénix-class submarines were medium sized ocean-going and long range boats authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these boats. They were similar to the Redoutable class though they were smaller and displaced 1,200 tons. They carried a similarly heavy torpedo armament."
 AEF_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Durand-Viel Design"
 AEF_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 AEF_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Dunkerque Class"
 AEF_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 AEF_battleship_1:0 "Courbet Class"
 AEF_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 AEF_battleship_2:0 "Richelieu Class"
 AEF_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 AEF_battleship_3:0 "Gascogne Class"
 AEF_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 AEF_battleship_4:0 "Alsace Class"
 AEF_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improves upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 AEF_carrier_1:0 "Béarn Class"
 AEF_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 AEF_carrier_2:0 "Joffre Class"
 AEF_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 AEF_carrier_3:0 "Jean Bart Class"
 AEF_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would provide a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 AEF_carrier_4:0 "Clemenceau Class"
 AEF_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."
 AEF_destroyer_1:0 "Bourrasque Class"

They were fast and well-armed for their time, but their torpedo armament is smaller compared to similar vessels in the other navies."
 AEF_destroyer_2:0 "Le Fantasque Class"
 AEF_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Le Fantasque-class destroyers were essentially improved versions of the earlier super destroyers of the 2,400-ton Series (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin) built under the 1930 naval program. They were large, heavily-armed, and very fast destroyers, perfect for escorting the new high speed units of the French fleet. Their armament consisted of newly developed guns, adequate AA, and torpedo armament."

 IND_submarine_1_desc:0 "The 600-ton Series of submarines were France's first modern post WWI submarines. They were medium sized, displacing around 600tons. Though they were seagoing ones, they were designated as coastal submarines and used mostly in warm waters of the Mediterranean. Three classes of 4 ships each built of this type: Sirène, Ariane and Circé classes. They were the basis of the bigger 630-ton Series the Argonaute, Diane and Orion classes."
 IND_submarine_2:0 "Minerve Class"
 IND_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardization program resulting of a centralized design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) rather than shipyard specific designs of the previous classes."
 IND_submarine_3:0 "Roland Morillot Class"
 IND_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Roland Morillot-class submarines (Project name Z2) were large ocean going submarines based on the earlier Redoubtable-class submarines. They were large submarines displacing 1,800-2,400 tons and carried a formidable armament of 10 torpedo tubes. The Fall of France occurred before any were finished."
 IND_submarine_4:0 "Phénix Class"
 IND_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Phénix-class submarines were medium sized ocean-going and long range boats authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these boats. They were similar to the Redoutable class though they were smaller and displaced 1,200 tons. They carried a similarly heavy torpedo armament."
 FRI_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Durand-Viel Design"
 FRI_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 FRI_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Dunkerque Class"
 FRI_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 FRI_battleship_1:0 "Courbet Class"
 FRI_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 FRI_battleship_2:0 "Richelieu Class"
 FRI_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 FRI_battleship_3:0 "Gascogne Class"
 FRI_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 FRI_battleship_4:0 "Alsace Class"
 FRI_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improves upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 FRI_carrier_1:0 "Béarn Class"
 FRI_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 FRI_carrier_2:0 "Joffre Class"
 FRI_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 FRI_carrier_3:0 "Jean Bart Class"
 FRI_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would provide a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 FRI_carrier_4:0 "Clemenceau Class"
 FRI_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."
 FRI_destroyer_1:0 "Bourrasque Class"
 FRI_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Bourrasque-class destroyers were part of the 1,500-ton Series, and launched in the mid 1920's. Together with the preceding Chacal and following L'Adroit classes, they were the backbone of the new modern post war French fleet. They were fast and well-armed for their time, but their torpedo armament is smaller compared to similar vessels in the other navies."
 FRI_destroyer_2:0 "Le Fantasque Class"
 FRI_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Le Fantasque-class destroyers were essentially improved versions of the earlier super destroyers of the 2,400-ton Series (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin) built under the 1930 naval program. They were large, heavily-armed, and very fast destroyers, perfect for escorting the new high speed units of the French fleet. Their armament consisted of newly developed guns, adequate AA, and torpedo armament."
 FRI_destroyer_3:0 "L'Intrépide Class"
 FRI_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers ware a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi class destroyers. They were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focused more on an anti-aircraft role, and had an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons had larger engines."
 FRI_destroyer_4:0 "Hoche Class"
 FRI_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines. They were authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these ships."
 FRI_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Suffren Class"
 FRI_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy; very thin armor but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
 FRI_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Algérie Class"
 FRI_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection is considerably increased. Its AA armament is adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement is over 10,000 tons."
 FRI_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Saint Louis Class"
 FRI_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armor would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
 FRI_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Forbin Class"
 FRI_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Forbin-class heavy cruisers were a hypothetical design as a follow up of the Saint Louis class. Designed to defend the trade lanes between Mainland France and the colonies, it had long range and good speed along with a heavy armament of guns in four triple turrets and an adequate number of AA weaponry. The ship layout and general look resembled an influence from the previous Saint Louis class as well as British Crown Colony class."
 FRI_light_cruiser_1:0 "Duguay-Trouin Class"
 FRI_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duguay-Trouin light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I in the 1922 naval program. They became the first light cruisers with super-firing enclosed main turrets. Among light cruisers, they had a strong torpedo armament but virtually nonexistent armor."
 FRI_light_cruiser_2:0 "La Galissonnière Class"
 FRI_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programs, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
 FRI_light_cruiser_3:0 "De Grasse Class"
 FRI_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 FRI_light_cruiser_4:0 "Colbert Class"
 FRI_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse is that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
 FRI_SH_battleship_1:0 "Charlemagne Class"
 FRI_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships is a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies.

 MAD_carrier_2:0 "Joffre Class"
 MAD_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 MAD_carrier_3:0 "Jean Bart Class"
 MAD_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would provide a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 MAD_carrier_4:0 "Clemenceau Class"
 MAD_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."
 MAD_destroyer_1:0 "Bourrasque Class"
 MAD_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Bourrasque-class destroyers were part of the 1,500-ton Series, and launched in the mid 1920's. Together with the preceding Chacal and following L'Adroit classes, they were the backbone of the new modern post war French fleet. They were fast and well-armed for their time, but their torpedo armament is smaller compared to similar vessels in the other navies."
 MAD_destroyer_2:0 "Le Fantasque Class"
 MAD_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Le Fantasque-class destroyers were essentially improved versions of the earlier super destroyers of the 2,400-ton Series (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin) built under the 1930 naval program. They were large, heavily-armed, and very fast destroyers, perfect for escorting the new high speed units of the French fleet. Their armament consisted of newly developed guns, adequate AA, and torpedo armament."
 MAD_destroyer_3:0 "L'Intrépide Class"
 MAD_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers ware a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi class destroyers. They were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focused more on an anti-aircraft role, and had an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons had larger engines."
 MAD_destroyer_4:0 "Hoche Class"
 MAD_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines. They were authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these ships."
 MAD_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Suffren Class"
 MAD_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy; very thin armor but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
 MAD_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Algérie Class"
 MAD_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection is considerably increased. Its AA armament is adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement is over 10,000 tons."
 MAD_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Saint Louis Class"
 MAD_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armor would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
 MAD_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Forbin Class"
 MAD_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Forbin-class heavy cruisers were a hypothetical design as a follow up of the Saint Louis class. Designed to defend the trade lanes between Mainland France and the colonies, it had long range and good speed along with a heavy armament of guns in four triple turrets and an adequate number of AA weaponry. The ship layout and general look resembled an influence from the previous Saint Louis class as well as British Crown Colony class."
 MAD_light_cruiser_1:0 "Duguay-Trouin Class"
 MAD_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duguay-Trouin light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I in the 1922 naval program. They became the first light cruisers with super-firing enclosed main turrets. Among light cruisers, they had a strong torpedo armament but virtually nonexistent armor."
 MAD_light_cruiser_2:0 "La Galissonnière Class"
 MAD_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programs, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
 MAD_light_cruiser_3:0 "De Grasse Class"
 MAD_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 MAD_light_cruiser_4:0 "Colbert Class"
 MAD_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse is that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
 MAD_SH_battleship_1:0 "Charlemagne Class"
 MAD_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships is a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They feature a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armor. The entire design borrows elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
 MAD_SH_battleship_2:0 "Napoléon Bonaparte Class"
 MAD_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament is distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armor and strong engines provide the speed and defense needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
 MAD_submarine_1:0 "600 Series"
 MAD_submarine_1_desc:0 "The 600-ton Series of submarines were France's first modern post WWI submarines. They were medium sized, displacing around 600tons. Though they were seagoing ones, they were designated as coastal submarines and used mostly in warm waters of the Mediterranean. Three classes of 4 ships each built of this type: Sirène, Ariane and Circé classes. They were the basis of the bigger 630-ton Series the Argonaute, Diane and Orion classes."
 MAD_submarine_2:0 "Minerve Class"
 MAD_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardization program resulting of a centralized design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) rather than shipyard specific designs of the previous classes."
 MAD_submarine_3:0 "Roland Morillot Class"
 MAD_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Roland Morillot-class submarines (Project name Z2) were large ocean going submarines based on the earlier Redoubtable-class submarines. They were large submarines displacing 1,800-2,400 tons and carried a formidable armament of 10 torpedo tubes. The Fall of France occurred before any were finished."
 MAD_submarine_4:0 "Phénix Class"
 MAD_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Phénix-class submarines were medium sized ocean-going and long range boats authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these boats. They were similar to the Redoutable class though they were smaller and displaced 1,200 tons. They carried a similarly heavy torpedo armament."
 TUN_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Durand-Viel Design"
 TUN_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 TUN_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Dunkerque Class"
 TUN_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 TUN_battleship_1:0 "Courbet Class"
 TUN_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 TUN_battleship_2:0 "Richelieu Class"
 TUN_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 TUN_battleship_3:0 "Gascogne Class"
 TUN_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 TUN_battleship_4:0 "Alsace Class"
 TUN_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improves upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 TUN_carrier_1:0 "Béarn Class"

Designed to defend the trade lanes between Mainland France and the colonies, it had long range and good speed along with a heavy armament of guns in four triple turrets and an adequate number of AA weaponry. The ship layout and general look resembled an influence from the previous Saint Louis class as well as British Crown Colony class."
 MOR_light_cruiser_1:0 "Duguay-Trouin Class"
 MOR_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duguay-Trouin light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I in the 1922 naval program. They became the first light cruisers with super-firing enclosed main turrets. Among light cruisers, they had a strong torpedo armament but virtually nonexistent armor."
 MOR_light_cruiser_2:0 "La Galissonnière Class"
 MOR_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programs, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
 MOR_light_cruiser_3:0 "De Grasse Class"
 MOR_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 MOR_light_cruiser_4:0 "Colbert Class"
 MOR_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse is that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
 MOR_SH_battleship_1:0 "Charlemagne Class"
 MOR_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships is a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They feature a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armor. The entire design borrows elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
 MOR_SH_battleship_2:0 "Napoléon Bonaparte Class"
 MOR_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament is distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armor and strong engines provide the speed and defense needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
 MOR_submarine_1:0 "600 Series"
 MOR_submarine_1_desc:0 "The 600-ton Series of submarines were France's first modern post WWI submarines. They were medium sized, displacing around 600tons. Though they were seagoing ones, they were designated as coastal submarines and used mostly in warm waters of the Mediterranean. Three classes of 4 ships each built of this type: Sirène, Ariane and Circé classes. They were the basis of the bigger 630-ton Series the Argonaute, Diane and Orion classes."
 MOR_submarine_2:0 "Minerve Class"
 MOR_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardization program resulting of a centralized design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) rather than shipyard specific designs of the previous classes."
 MOR_submarine_3:0 "Roland Morillot Class"
 MOR_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Roland Morillot-class submarines (Project name Z2) were large ocean going submarines based on the earlier Redoubtable-class submarines. They were large submarines displacing 1,800-2,400 tons and carried a formidable armament of 10 torpedo tubes. The Fall of France occurred before any were finished."
 MOR_submarine_4:0 "Phénix Class"
 MOR_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Phénix-class submarines were medium sized ocean-going and long range boats authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these boats. They were similar to the Redoutable class though they were smaller and displaced 1,200 tons. They carried a similarly heavy torpedo armament."
 SYR_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Durand-Viel Design"
 SYR_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 SYR_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Dunkerque Class"
 SYR_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 SYR_battleship_1:0 "Courbet Class"
 SYR_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 SYR_battleship_2:0 "Richelieu Class"
 SYR_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 SYR_battleship_3:0 "Gascogne Class"
 SYR_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 SYR_battleship_4:0 "Alsace Class"
 SYR_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improves upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 SYR_carrier_1:0 "Béarn Class"
 SYR_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 SYR_carrier_2:0 "Joffre Class"
 SYR_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 SYR_carrier_3:0 "Jean Bart Class"
 SYR_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would provide a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 SYR_carrier_4:0 "Clemenceau Class"
 SYR_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."
 SYR_destroyer_1:0 "Bourrasque Class"
 SYR_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Bourrasque-class destroyers were part of the 1,500-ton Series, and launched in the mid 1920's. Together with the preceding Chacal and following L'Adroit classes, they were the backbone of the new modern post war French fleet. They were fast and well-armed for their time, but their torpedo armament is smaller compared to similar vessels in the other navies."
 SYR_destroyer_2:0 "Le Fantasque Class"
 SYR_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Le Fantasque-class destroyers were essentially improved versions of the earlier super destroyers of the 2,400-ton Series (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin) built under the 1930 naval program. They were large, heavily-armed, and very fast destroyers, perfect for escorting the new high speed units of the French fleet. Their armament consisted of newly developed guns, adequate AA, and torpedo armament."
 SYR_destroyer_3:0 "L'Intrépide Class"
 SYR_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers ware a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi class destroyers. They were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focused more on an anti-aircraft role, and had an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons had larger engines."
 SYR_destroyer_4:0 "Hoche Class"
 SYR_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines. They were authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these ships."
 SYR_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Suffren Class"
 SYR_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy; very thin armor but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
 SYR_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Algérie Class"
 SYR_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection is considerably increased. Its AA armament is adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement is over 10,000 tons."
 SYR_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Saint Louis Class"
 SYR_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armor would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."

They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 FRA_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Dunkerque Class"
 FRA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 FRA_battleship_1:0 "Courbet Class"
 FRA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 FRA_battleship_2:0 "Richelieu Class"
 FRA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 FRA_battleship_3:0 "Gascogne Class"
 FRA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 FRA_battleship_4:0 "Alsace Class"
 FRA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improves upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 FRA_carrier_1:0 "Béarn Class"
 FRA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 FRA_carrier_2:0 "Joffre Class"
 FRA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 FRA_carrier_3:0 "Jean Bart Class"
 FRA_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would provide a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 FRA_carrier_4:0 "Clemenceau Class"
 FRA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."
 FRA_destroyer_1:0 "Bourrasque Class"
 FRA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Bourrasque-class destroyers were part of the 1,500-ton Series, and launched in the mid 1920's. Together with the preceding Chacal and following L'Adroit classes, they were the backbone of the new modern post war French fleet. They were fast and well-armed for their time, but their torpedo armament is smaller compared to similar vessels in the other navies."
 FRA_destroyer_2:0 "Le Fantasque Class"
 FRA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Le Fantasque-class destroyers were essentially improved versions of the earlier super destroyers of the 2,400-ton Series (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin) built under the 1930 naval program. They were large, heavily-armed, and very fast destroyers, perfect for escorting the new high speed units of the French fleet. Their armament consisted of newly developed guns, adequate AA, and torpedo armament."
 FRA_destroyer_3:0 "L'Intrépide Class"
 FRA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers ware a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi class destroyers. They were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focused more on an anti-aircraft role, and had an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons had larger engines."
 FRA_destroyer_4:0 "Hoche Class"
 FRA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines. They were authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these ships."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Suffren Class"
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy; very thin armor but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Algérie Class"
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection is considerably increased. Its AA armament is adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement is over 10,000 tons."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Saint Louis Class"
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armor would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Forbin Class"
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Forbin-class heavy cruisers were a hypothetical design as a follow up of the Saint Louis class. Designed to defend the trade lanes between Mainland France and the colonies, it had long range and good speed along with a heavy armament of guns in four triple turrets and an adequate number of AA weaponry. The ship layout and general look resembled an influence from the previous Saint Louis class as well as British Crown Colony class."
 FRA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Duguay-Trouin Class"
 FRA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duguay-Trouin light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I in the 1922 naval program. They became the first light cruisers with super-firing enclosed main turrets. Among light cruisers, they had a strong torpedo armament but virtually nonexistent armor."
 FRA_light_cruiser_2:0 "La Galissonnière Class"
 FRA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programs, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
 FRA_light_cruiser_3:0 "De Grasse Class"
 FRA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 FRA_light_cruiser_4:0 "Colbert Class"
 FRA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse is that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
 FRA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Charlemagne Class"
 FRA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships is a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They feature a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armor. The entire design borrows elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
 FRA_SH_battleship_2:0 "Napoléon Bonaparte Class"
 FRA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament is distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armor and strong engines provide the speed and defense needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
 FRA_submarine_1:0 "600 Series"
 FRA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The 600-ton Series of submarines were France's first modern post WWI submarines. They were medium sized, displacing around 600tons. Though they were seagoing ones, they were designated as coastal submarines and used mostly in warm waters of the Mediterranean. Three classes of 4 ships each built of this type: Sirène, Ariane and Circé classes. They were the basis of the bigger 630-ton Series the Argonaute, Diane and Orion classes."
 FRA_submarine_2:0 "Minerve Class"
 FRA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardization program resulting of a centralized design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) rather than shipyard specific designs of the previous classes."
 FRA_submarine_3:0 "Roland Morillot Class"
 FRA_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Roland Morillot-class submarines (Project name Z2) were large ocean going submarines based on the earlier Redoubtable-class submarines. They were large submarines displacing 1,800-2,400 tons and carried a formidable armament of 10 torpedo tubes. The Fall of France occurred before any were finished."
 FRA_submarine_4:0 "Phénix Class"
 FRA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Phénix-class submarines were medium sized ocean-going and long range boats authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these boats. They were similar to the Redoutable class though they were smaller and displaced 1,200 tons. They carried a similarly heavy torpedo armament."

They were the first ships designed specifically to the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited cruisers to 10,000 tons and 8 in. guns. The last ship of the class, the Bolzano, was an improved design launched in 1932."
 ITA_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "San Giorgio Class"
 ITA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The San Giorgio class is a hypothetical class of interwar heavy cruisers that would have been launched shortly before the start of the war. These cruisers would displace over 11,000 tons and mount eight 203mm Ansaldo guns."
 ITA_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Pisa Class"
 ITA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Pisa class is a hypothetical heavy cruiser from the mid-war era. It displaced around 12,000 tons and acted as the lead of its own patrol force."
 ITA_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Garibaldi Class"
 ITA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Garibaldi class is a hypothetical class of late-war heavy cruisers. It displaced about 14,000 tons, was well-armed with eight 203mm OTO/Ansaldo guns, and could keep up with most carriers and other capital ships."
 ITA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Taranto Class"
 ITA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The cruisers Taranto and Bari were World War I-era cruisers obtained from Germany as reparations. Both displaced between 4,500 and 5,100 tons and were armed with German 150mm SK/45 guns."
 ITA_light_cruiser_2:0 "Duca degli Abruzzi"
 ITA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Duca degli Abruzzi class was the fifth subclass of the Condottieri-class light cruisers. They were built before World War II to gain predominance in the Mediterranean Sea. They were the largest Italian light cruisers commissioned during the war, displacing over 9,400 tons. They were well-armored and mount ten 152mm Ansaldo guns."
 ITA_light_cruiser_3:0 "Capitani Romani Class"
 ITA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Capitani Romani light cruisers were essentially designed to outrun and outgun the large new French destroyers of the late 1930s. Twelve hulls were ordered in late 1939, but only three were completed before the Italian armistice in 1943. They were lightly armored and displaced only 3,700 tons, but were quite fast. They mount eight 135mm OTO/Ansaldo guns."
 ITA_light_cruiser_4:0 "San Marco Class"
 ITA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The San Marco class is an improved version of the earlier Capitani Romani light cruisers. Due to the Italian armistice the San Marco, and her redesigned sister ship the San Giorgio, were not commissioned until the 1950s."
 ITA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Regina Margherita Class"
 ITA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Regina Margherita class is a hypothetical class of heavy battleships that would have been launched shortly before the start of the war. They would be comparable to the Japanese Yamato class battleships. They would be very well-armored, displace about 60,000 tons, and be armed with 406mm guns."
 ITA_SH_battleship_2:0 "Regina Elena Class"
 ITA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Regina Elena class is a hypothetical class of heavy battleships that would be launched around the time of Italy's entry into the war. They were comparable to the Montana class battleships planned by the U.S. They were highly armored, displaced over 70,000 tons, and were armed with 406mm guns in their main battery."
 ITA_submarine_1:0 "Mameli Class"
 ITA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Geoffredo Mameli class is a class of medium submarines of the Regia Marina launched between 1926 and 1928. They displaced just under 800 tons and had a diving depth of 100m. They were the basis for subsequent models such as the Pisani, Bandiera, and Squalo classes."
 ITA_submarine_2:0 "Perla Class"
 ITA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Perla-class and Adua-class submarines were built in the 1930s. They were the third and fourth sub-classes of the 600 Series of submarines built by Italy. They were smaller than their predecessors, displacing just over 600 tons."
 ITA_submarine_3:0 "Marconi Class"
 ITA_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Marconi class was a class of six submarines built between 1939 and 1940 and succeeded the earlier Luizzi submarines. The submarines of both classes displaced about 1,000 tons and had eight 533mm torpedo tubes. Only one ship of the two classes combined survived the war."
 ITA_submarine_4:0 "Pietro Calvi Class"
 ITA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Pietro Calvi subclass involved only minor improvements over the preceding Flutto class, which was a class of medium-sized submarines. Only a handful were launched, as most hulls were captured by the Germans after the Italian armistice. A redesigned version of the Pietro Calvi was finally commissioned in 1961."
